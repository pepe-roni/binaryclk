# Binary Clock
Arduino LED Binary Clock!

# Description
This is a rewritten version of the Arduino Binary clock, but with 24HR time and a switch to turn off LEDs but keep the clock running so you won't have to set it again! Inspired to create this because I stained a plank of wood as test piece and it seemed like the perfect size for a binary clock. Contact me if you have issues!
